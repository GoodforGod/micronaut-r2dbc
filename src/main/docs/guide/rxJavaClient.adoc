By default R2DBC is not opinonated about clients, therefore you can use the R2DBC `ConnectionFactory` with any https://r2dbc.io/clients/[external R2DBC client] you choose.

As part of this project there is an experimental RxJava 2 client which you can add with the following dependency:

dependency::io.micronaut.r2dbc:micronaut-r2dbc-rxjava2[version="{version}]

Which allows you to inject a `RxConnectionFactory` bean that allows you to do basic operations with R2DBC, for example inserts:

snippet::example.BookControllerTest[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="test", tags="insert", indent="0"]

Or read operations:

snippet::example.BookController[project-base="doc-examples/example", source="main", tags="read", indent="0"]
